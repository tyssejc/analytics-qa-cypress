# Analytics QA with Cypress

H/t to @jexner and Lukas Oldenburg and Justin Schwartzenberger



## Process

- I like cypress. I also like puppeteer. @jexner has a good setup for using puppeteer, you can find it here.
- I'm using cypress 10 because I couldn't figure out how to get v11 to work with cypress-cucumber-preprocessor (which seems to have a new maintainer). If you can get it to work, please submit a PR.
